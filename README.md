# insertion-sort

A main class with a psvm method has been created for you as a start.  There is also an example class for a bubble sort.

Your task is to create a similar class to the bubble sort except using an insertion sort.  You will also need to extend the psvm method to create an instance of a new insertion object and display your results.

Remember, the primary objective of these tasks at the moment is to work with the essential algorithms for A Level Computer Science (you need to know them very well); your understanding of linear search and binary search will also be checked shortly (<- is that a hint?).

The secondary objective is to develop understanding of using the Java programming lanuage and if you have time you can try completing some of the tasks below (you may also think of other things that you want to explore yourself): 
- Convert the public variable in bubble and insertion sort classes to private and use "getters" and "setters".
- Once a set of inputs has been entered and sorted let the program run again if a user wants it to.
- Add another private variable to the insertion and bubble classes that keeps the sorted and unsorted list of each different list entered accessible.
- Sort lists of integers
